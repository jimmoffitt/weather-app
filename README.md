## Intro

This project was first set up to experiment with Netlify. After finding an example app with a weather data focus, that repository was cloned and deplyed to Netlify. 
Once deployed and hosted on that platform, this app is being used to learn more about React by adding in a Twitter connector.  

### This web app project was cloned from https://github.com/hicodersofficial/weather-app.

See that ‚¨ÜÔ∏è repository's README ‚¨ÜÔ∏è for installation and configuration details. I did not need to change any of those details
to get this app up and running. 


### Preview of this project: 
This app is hosted at react-wander.netlify.app
üåê **[Live Preview](https://react-wander.netlify.app)**

These apps are hosted on Netlify. The cloned project built out of the box and was easily deployed with Netlify. 
To get the weather data to appear, you will need to move up from the free level of API access.  

Here's a preview of what this webapp generates:
